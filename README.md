# BLE Peripheral Simulator

The BLE Peripheral Simulator is an Android app that allows developers to try
out new features of Cassia Router without the need for a BLE Peripheral Device.

APP broadcast instructions:

* Device broadcast identification: Name is Cassia Demo App.
* Parameters: LegacyMode, Connectable, Scannable, Interval(160ms), TxPowerLevel(1)
* The broadcast packet is updated every 0.5 second
* The broadcast packet contains body temperature and heart rate data
* Temperature data is a random number between 35.00 and 40.00
* Heart rate data is a random number between 50 and 140
* Example broadcast package: 0201020EFFFFFF1819958D293D00000000000416372A5D07161C2A00000E07
    * 1819958D293D: fixed mac, or uid, starts with 0x18, 0x19
    * 00000000000: reserved manufacturer data
    * 5D: heart rate, 93
    * 0E07: temperature, 0x0E07 / 100 = 35.91℃
* Example of Scan response package: 12094361737369612044656d6f20417070
    * 4361737369612044656d6f20417070: Cassia Demo App

The developer can use the Cassia Router features to connect to the app to Read and Write Characteristics, Subscribe to Notifications for when the Characteristics change, and Read and Write Descriptors.

From the app a developer can set the characteristics' values, send notifications and disconnect.

### Caveats
* Please keep the App front when using.
* Please close the app in time when not in use to prevent the battery from draining quickly.
* BLE broadcast uses API level 26, and currently only supports Android 8 or higher versions.
* Due to hardware chipset dependency, some devices don't have access to this feature. Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26482611/chipsets-devices-supporting-android-5-ble-peripheral-mode.

### Todo List
* App add gatt auth
* App add LED service
* App add stopping-advertising switch
* App add temperature display
* App add version display
* App disconnect function
* Adapt to lower version android
